# Memory Game Project

A simple memory game using image tiles. It was created to teach students how to use jQuery to retrieve attributes, set attributes and to handle click actions. It also teaches the use of for loops.

The game ending part is a bit hacky! We'll work on that!

The game is hosted <a href="https://lechien73.github.io/memorygame" target="_blank">on GitHub Pages here</a>
